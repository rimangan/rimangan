### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Riley, and I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Molecular Genetics and Microbiology
at Duke University. My major research interests are in the evolution of gene regulation, 
computational biology, and neurodevelopment. I am a lead developer on Gonomics, an open-source
repository for genomics software in the Go programming language.
