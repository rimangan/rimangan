### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Riley, and I'm an incoming postdoc with the Kellis lab at MIT CSAIL. I received my Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics and Microbiology
from Duke University. My major research interests are in the evolution of gene regulation, 
computational biology, and neurodevelopment. I am a lead developer on Gonomics, an open-source
repository for genomics software in the Go programming language.
